My interests cover \textbf{big data analytics systems} and \textbf{cloud computing}, with a special focus on \textbf{machine learning systems}. I enjoy identifying fundamental system design and performance issues in large-scale ML systems for both training and inference, and searching for general and efficient solutions.

\textbf{Fast Secure Federated Learning System}
\vspace{2pt}
\begin{compactenum}[-]
\item Inter-enterprise federated learning with Homomorphic Encryption
\item Accelerate training and inference of Secure Federated Learning
\item Mitigate encryption and communication overhead
\end{compactenum}
\vspace{5pt}

% I am currently working on accelerating the training and inference process of secure federated learning. We partner with a large commercial bank, and focus on enabling inter-enterprise federated learning with the help of Homomorphic Encryption. Specifically, I am working on how to mitigate the encryption and communication overhead. \\[-0.4em]

\textbf{MArk: ML Serving on Public Cloud}
\vspace{2pt}
\begin{compactenum}[-]
\item Serve machine learning inference on public cloud
\item Cost-effective and SLO-aware
\item Characterization of ML serving and its performance cloud services
\item Combine FaaS and IaaS to reduce over-provisioning
\item Characterization of hardware accelerators like GPU and TPU
\end{compactenum}
\vspace{5pt}
% We aspired to serve machine learning models on public cloud with both SLO compliance and cost-effectiveness. We first characterized ML serving and its performance on diverse cloud services, and then designed MArk based on our insights. MArk uses predictive autoscaling to maintain high utilization, and eliminates over-provisioning by utilizing flexible, yet expensive FaaS. MArk further brings down the cost by adopting ML accelerators judiciously. \\[-0.4em]

\textbf{Speculative Synchronization}
\vspace{2pt}
\begin{compactenum}[-]
\item Distributed data parallel training
\item Relaxed consistency can increase throughput but hurt update quality
\item Re-synchronize if the parameter copy is too stale to produce beneficial updates
\end{compactenum}
% \vspace{5pt}
% Asynchronous parallel can improve distributed ML training's throughput. However, the introduced inconsistency leads to low quality updates. We proposed Speculative Synchronization to exploit the trade-off between training throughput and update quality, which allows a worker to abort the current computation and synchronize, if it is confident that the benefits of fresher parameter outweight the loss of completed computation.
